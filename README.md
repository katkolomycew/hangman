Hangman â€” October 2019 (_nology)

Since as a group we felt that we needed more briefs and specifically more challenges while working in pairs or groups of three, one of our coworkers handed out a brief to build a hangman game through vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I worked on a three-person team, contributing most through small adjustments of deisgn and some concepts in JavaScript such as for loops and arrays.
